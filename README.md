# Project Push Swap

## Overview
The Push Swap project at School 42 asks us to implement an algorithm to sort a stack of integers using a specific set of instructions. This project focuses on algorithmic complexity, optimisation, and (depending on your implementation) the effective use of linked lists in a sorting context.

## Importance of Authentic Learning
📚 **Authentic Learning:** 📚
At its core, School 42 encourages a culture of authentic learning. The emphasis lies not only in flawless execution but in understanding concepts, problem-solving, and honing coding skills. Copying or cheating dilutes the essence of this learning experience, hindering personal growth and skill development. **For 42 students who might read this, I strongly advocate for discussing concepts with peers instead of directly referring to this code.** If you came here for advices, my advice would be: go talk to other students about this project it has been done by thousands!

## What is School 42?
🏫 **About School 42:** 🏫
School 42 is a unique coding school that operates under a peer-to-peer learning system. It fosters an environment where students learn by doing, collaborating, and problem-solving. At School 42, the projects are designed to impart practical knowledge and skill-building rather than focusing solely on theoretical aspects.

### Insights from the Project
🧠 **What future-me thinks he learned coding push_swap:** 🧠
Surely push_swap helped understand the concepts of complexity and the use of algorithms. It's a neat study-case. However, due to the restricted set of allowed instructions and the scoring based solely on their usage for sorting, the resulting algorithm does not come close to exhibiting high efficiency. This project helped me understand linked listed way more than understanding algorithmic thinking.
